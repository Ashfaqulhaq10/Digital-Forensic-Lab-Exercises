### üß∞ Tools & Requirements
| Tool / Resource | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| **Process Explorer** | Advanced Windows utility for process monitoring |
| **Windows OS** | Required platform to run the tool |
| **Administrator Privileges** | Needed to access all system processes |
| **Internet Connection** | For verifying suspicious process reputations |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Procedure

#### Step 1: Download and Launch
1. Go to the [Microsoft Sysinternals Process Explorer page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer).  
2. Download the ZIP archive.  
3. Extract the folder to a working directory.  
4. Run `procexp64.exe` or `procexp.exe` **as Administrator**.

#### Step 2: Explore the Interface
- The process tree shows all active processes.  
- Color coding for quick status recognition:

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Pink | Suspended processes |
| Light Blue | Processes under the same user |
| Dark Blue | System services or processes running under system accounts |
| Green | Newly started processes |
| Red | Recently terminated processes |

#### Step 3: Investigate Suspicious Processes
1. **Unknown processes**: Look for unfamiliar names; system processes are usually from trusted vendors like Microsoft.  
2. **Digital signatures**: Right-click ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Image tab. Unsigned executables can be suspicious.  
3. **File path**: System files are normally in `C:\Windows\System32`; others may be risky.  
4. **Resource usage**: High CPU, memory, or disk usage can indicate malware.  
5. **Process details**: Lack of description or unclear company name may be suspicious.  
6. **Network activity**: Properties ‚Üí TCP/IP tab; unexpected connections may indicate malicious behavior.

#### Step 4: Verify Process Reputation
- Search the process name online.  
- Check databases like [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) or [ProcessLibrary](https://www.processlibrary.com/).

#### Step 5: Take Action
1. **Kill Process**: Right-click ‚Üí Kill Process.  
2. **Suspend Process**: Right-click ‚Üí Suspend.  
3. **Delete Executable**: Remove the file if confirmed malicious.

#### Step 6: Scan the System
- Run a full antivirus scan.  
- Use tools like Malwarebytes or Windows Defender for thorough cleaning.

### üîç Observations
| Process Name | Action Taken | Notes |
|--------------|--------------|-------|
| unknown.exe | Suspended | Running from Temp folder, unsigned |
| svchost.exe | Monitored | Legitimate system process, high CPU briefly |
| appdatahelper.exe | Killed | Malicious, confirmed via VirusTotal |

---

### üìà Result
Process Explorer successfully identified suspicious or unusual processes and allowed safe investigation and corrective action.

---

### üìö Conclusion
Process Explorer provides detailed monitoring of Windows processes. Combining process inspection with reputation verification helps detect malware and protect system integrity.
